Customer behavior analysis is the study of how consumers interact with products and services, from the point of initial awareness to the final decision-making process. It involves collecting and interpreting data related to purchasing patterns, preferences, motivations, and responses to marketing efforts. By analyzing customer behavior, businesses gain insights into what drives customer decisions, helping them tailor marketing strategies, improve product offerings, and enhance the overall customer experience. This analysis often includes segmenting customers based on demographics, tracking online and offline interactions, and using predictive analytics to forecast future behavior. Effective customer behavior analysis enables businesses to create personalized experiences, boost customer loyalty, and drive revenue growth.
